# Light_monitor
Do check out the LIGHT MONITOR project that I implemented on the Bolt Cloud. Click the link below to open the dashboard ðŸ‘‡ðŸ˜Š  https://cloud.boltiot.com/control?name=BOLT8022159  Basically the project is about measuring the intensity of light, It is very helpful for plants, we can check if the plants are getting enough light or not and we can even check that, in which area we have maximum light intensity and so on...  Here is the graph showing the intensity of light in various interval of time and conditions!  In my LIGHT MONITOR PROJECT I have used:-   1Ã— Bolt IOT module  1Ã— Micro USB cable 1Ã— LDR ( 2 legged device with a red pattern disk on top )  1Ã— 10k Ohm resistor ( brown black orange colour code)  Let me know what you think about it !! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“ˆ
